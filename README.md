### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
[Link](https://behapy.s3.amazonaws.com/40/32/504032/default.jpg) and ![Image](That's Right!)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SaadAAkash/PyStuffsForNC/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
